aero
====

The aero command line package recycler. It uses package managers you already have.

When you type `aero search php`, it will search through your installed local and global package managers and use the most appropriate.

We plan to support:

  - brew
  - apt-get
  - npm global
  - npm local
  - composer local
  - PEAR
  - gem
  - pip
